## Design

### Process

The development of the Readwizards website began with brainstorming and research focused on creating a fun, interactive platform for young readers. I explored various children’s educational and entertainment sites to gather ideas, paying attention to their design, layout, and interactive features. This research helped me identify key elements to make Readwizards visually appealing and easy to navigate.

The website was designed with a colorful, magical theme that invites users to engage with stories and games. I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the pages, ensuring a clean, responsive layout using CSS Flexbox. Key animations, like floating images of wizard characters, were achieved with CSS keyframes, enhancing the whimsical feel.

To make the site interactive, I incorporated JavaScript for the games and challenges. JavaScript powers real-time features like question and answer games, timers, and score tracking. For example, on the Quest Challenge pages, users can select answers and receive immediate feedback, making the experience more dynamic and engaging.

Testing was a crucial part of the development process. I conducted usability testing with children and parents to refine the user experience. Feedback was also gathered from my mentor, helping to improve site navigation and ensure the interactive elements worked smoothly.

The final result is a magical, user-friendly website where children can explore stories, play games, and embark on wizardly quests, all powered by JavaScript for interactivity and CSS for stunning visual effects.



![Gantt Chart](documentation/gantt-chart.png)

### Color Scheme

The Readwizards website uses a vibrant and bold color palette to create an engaging, modern, and dynamic experience for visitors.

#6610F2 (Vibrant Purple) is the primary color used throughout the site to evoke creativity, innovation, and a sense of energy. It highlights key design elements and adds a touch of excitement to the brand’s identity, making it stand out.

#9B0DA8 (Deep Purple) is used for accents and calls to action, reinforcing the brand’s bold, distinctive personality. It brings a sense of sophistication and depth, encouraging visitors to explore and interact with the content.

#B10DC9 (Bright Magenta) complements the purple tones and adds a playful, yet professional vibe. It’s used sparingly to draw attention to important elements, such as buttons or links, without overwhelming the design.

#276D26 (Forest Green) adds a natural, grounded touch to the overall palette. This color conveys balance, growth, and trust, and it is used strategically to promote a sense of stability and harmony.

#874AE9 (Soft Purple) acts as a secondary accent, softening the boldness of the primary purples. It adds warmth and highlights subtle details, contributing to the overall flow of the design while maintaining a fresh and approachable look.

Together, these colors create a harmonious balance of boldness and approachability, while staying true to the Readwizards brand’s modern, professional, and creative ethos.

### Typography

- The Nova Cut font was selected to give the Readwizards brand a bold, modern, and dynamic look. Its clean lines and strong presence highlight key elements, like the logo, and help reinforce the brand’s personality, making it easy for visitors to connect and engage with the content.

![Trebuchet MS](documentation/nova-cut.png)


### Wireframes

- The wireframe for the Readwizards website was created to outline the structure and design of key pages before development. It provides a visual guide to the layout, navigation, and UI components, helping ensure a clear and intuitive user experience.

- You can view and download the wireframe in PDF format from the link below:

  - [Wireframe PDF](documentation/wireframe.pdf)

- Acting as a blueprint for the website, the wireframe helped shape the overall user experience (UX) and keep the design aligned with our goals and your needs. Since the wireframe was first created, I have made several updates to improve the experience, including the addition of bottom links to enhance navigation across the site.

## Future Improvements

- Custom 404 Page: Design a unique 404 error page to improve user experience when they encounter a broken link or incorrect URL. 
- Build the entire website in a single HTML file, simplifying the structure and potentially improving loading times. This will allow for quicker navigation while still maintaining a clean and responsive design.
