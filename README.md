## Design

### Process

The development of the Readwizards website began with brainstorming and research focused on creating a fun, interactive platform for young readers. I explored various children’s educational and entertainment sites to gather ideas, paying attention to their design, layout, and interactive features. This research helped me identify key elements to make Readwizards visually appealing and easy to navigate.

The website was designed with a colorful, magical theme that invites users to engage with stories and games. I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the pages, ensuring a clean, responsive layout using CSS Flexbox. Key animations, like floating images of wizard characters, were achieved with CSS keyframes, enhancing the whimsical feel.

To make the site interactive, I incorporated JavaScript for the games and challenges. JavaScript powers real-time features like question and answer games, timers, and score tracking. For example, on the Quest Challenge pages, users can select answers and receive immediate feedback, making the experience more dynamic and engaging.

Testing was a crucial part of the development process. I conducted usability testing with children and parents to refine the user experience. Feedback was also gathered from my mentor, helping to improve site navigation and ensure the interactive elements worked smoothly.

The final result is a magical, user-friendly website where children can explore stories, play games, and embark on wizardly quests, all powered by JavaScript for interactivity and CSS for stunning visual effects.

### Color Scheme

- The website uses a black, white, and grey color scheme for a clean, modern aesthetic and a professional look.
- Black is used for key design elements to evoke sophistication, elegance, and timelessness, reinforcing the brand's high-quality and fashionable identity.
- White serves as the primary background color, creating a clean, minimalistic look that allows the products to stand out while promoting a sense of freshness and simplicity.
- Grey is incorporated as a subtle accent color, adding depth and balance to the overall design without detracting from the brand's sleek, contemporary feel.

### Typography

- The Trebuchet MS font was used to give the Honeydrew brand a modern, clean, and approachable feel. It helps draw attention to key elements like the logo, highlights the brand's strengths, and encourages visitors to engage with the brand, whether through browsing collections or making a pre-order.

![Trebuchet MS](documentation/font.png)


### Wireframes

- The wireframe for the Honeydrew website was designed to map out the structure and layout of key pages before development. It provides a visual representation of the website’s design elements, including navigation, content placement, and user interface (UI) components.

- You can view and download the wireframe in PDF format from the link below:

  - [Wireframe PDF](documentation/wireframes.pdf)

- The wireframe serves as a blueprint for the site, ensuring that the user experience (UX) is intuitive and well-organized. It helped guide the design process, ensuring that the layout aligned with the brand's goals and user needs. Several changes were made since the creation of the wireframe to improve the user experience (UX), including the addition of bottom links to the website pages for eas
