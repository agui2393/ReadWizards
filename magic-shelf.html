                    <p id="text-purple">One morning, Jax Blaze and Skye Skates were practicing their favorite moves in
                        the
                        wizarding courtyard. Jax was spinning and twirling, his fiery staff sending sparks into the air
                        with
                        every dance step. Skye zipped by on her roller skates, leaving a sparkling trail of stardust
                        behind
                        her.</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">Suddenly, a glowing envelope appeared in front of them. It floated down gently,
                        landing right at Skye’s feet. She bent down and picked it up, feeling the magic buzz through her
                        fingers.</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">"It’s from the Grand Wizard of the Enchanted Grove!" Skye said, reading the
                        letter
                        aloud. "You are both invited to unlock the secrets of the Grove. A treasure awaits—only if you
                        solve
                        its magical puzzles."</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">Jax’s eyes sparkled with excitement. "A treasure hunt? Count me in!" he said,
                        twirling his staff. "Let’s dance our way to it!"
                        Skye smiled, adjusting her skates. "And I’ll roll there with style. Let’s go, Jax!"
                        They grabbed their gear—Jax’s magical staff and Skye’s glowing roller skates—and set off toward
                        the
                        Enchanted Grove, eager to uncover its mysteries.</p>

                    <p id="text-purple">Jax Blaze and Skye Skates made their way through the sparkling
                        meadow, heading
                        toward the Enchanted Grove. The air was filled with the scent of sweet flowers, and
                        the trees
                        around
                        them shimmered in shades of gold and emerald. It was a place of magic, where the
                        ordinary and
                        extraordinary met.</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">As they walked, Skye skated effortlessly ahead, her glowing wheels
                        leaving a
                        trail
                        of glittering stardust behind her. Jax, on the other hand, was twirling his fiery
                        staff, making
                        the
                        flames dance and flicker with every twist.</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">“I can’t believe we’re actually going to the Enchanted Grove,” Jax
                        said, his
                        voice
                        full of wonder. “I’ve heard stories about its hidden secrets. They say that only the
                        bravest
                        wizards
                        can find the treasure.”</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">“I’ve always loved puzzles,” Skye said with a confident smile. “I
                        think we’re
                        going
                        to be great at solving them. Together, we’re unstoppable!”
                        Just as Skye spoke, the path ahead of them began to shimmer and glow, revealing a
                        trail of
                        glowing
                        stones leading into the forest.
                    </p>
                    <p id="text-purple">“That’s our path,” Skye said, skating back to Jax. “Looks like we’re
                        going the
                        right
                        way!”
                        They both stepped forward, following the glowing trail deeper into the forest. The
                        trees seemed
                        to
                        whisper around them, their branches swaying gently in the wind, as if inviting them
                        closer.
                        Suddenly, a soft, melodic voice echoed from the trees. “To enter the Grove, you must
                        first solve
                        the
                        riddle of the forest.”</p>
                    <p id="text-purple">“The riddle is simple, yet tricky. Answer it correctly, and the path
                        will open.
                        Fail, and you’ll find yourselves lost forever.”
                        Jax and Skye exchanged a glance. They were ready for anything.
                        The owl’s voice rang out once more. “What flies without wings, and can bring both
                        joy and
                        sorrow?”
                        Jax thought for a moment. “That’s easy,” he said confidently. “It’s time! Time flies
                        without
                        wings,
                        and it can bring both happiness and sadness depending on what you do with it.”
                        The owl’s eyes glowed brightly. “Correct,” it said, and with a flap of its wings,
                        the trees
                        parted,
                        revealing the entrance to the Enchanted Grove.
                        Skye clapped her hands. “We did it! On to the next challenge!”</p>

            </div>

            <div id="border-story">
                <p id="text-purple">Jax and Skye ventured deeper into the Enchanted Grove, the air thick
                    with magic
                    and
                    mystery. The trees seemed to whisper secrets as they passed, and the ground beneath
                    their feet
                    was
                    soft, like walking on moss. They arrived at a stone pedestal in the clearing, bathed in
                    an
                    otherworldly glow. On top of the pedestal was an ancient book, its pages turning by
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <p id="text-purple">Skye stepped forward and opened the book. A deep, rumbling voice echoed
                    through
                    the
                    Grove:</p>
                <p id="text-purple">“To unlock the treasure, you must solve this riddle:
                    ‘I am something that can be both high and low.
                    I can shine, but I don’t always glow.
                    I’m with you every night and day.
                    What am I, can you say?’”</p>
                <p id="text-purple">The words seemed to shimmer as they floated before them. Skye frowned
                    for a
                    moment,
                    her mind racing. Jax leaned in, watching her carefully.
                    “I’ve heard this riddle before,” Skye murmured. “It’s the moon. It can be high in the
                    sky, or
                    low on
                    the horizon. It shines, but not all the time. And it's always with us, night and day.”
                </p>
                <p id="text-purple">Jax’s eyes widened with excitement. “It’s the moon! You’re right!”
                    As soon as Skye spoke the answer aloud, the pedestal’s glow intensified, and the book
                    snapped
                    shut
                    with a soft thud. A hidden compartment in the pedestal opened, revealing a glowing
                    crystal that
                    pulsed with magical energy. The crystal shimmered brightly before them.
                    “We did it!” Jax exclaimed, jumping with joy.</p>
                <p id="text-purple">Skye smiled, feeling a wave of satisfaction. The crystal was a key, but
                    it was
                    also
                    a symbol of their growing power. They’d solved the riddle, but the Grove’s mysteries
                    weren’t
                    over
                    yet.
                    The pedestal began to rise, revealing a new path leading deeper into the Grove. The air
                    shimmered
                    with anticipation as the two adventurers exchanged a determined glance.
                    “Let’s go,” Skye said, her voice filled with excitement. “The treasure is waiting.”
                    With that, they stepped forward, ready for whatever challenge lay ahead.</p>
